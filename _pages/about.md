<img src="/images/profile2.png" alt="drawing" width="390" height="300" style="float: left; padding-right:15px"/>  I joined MIT's Economics Department as an Assistant Professor in July 2023 after a postdoc at the LSE. I am also the Executive Director of the [Hub for Equal Representation](https://www.hubequalrep.org/) at the LSE. I received my Phd in Economics from UC Berkeley. <br>

My research is in the fields of labor, gender and public economics, with a particular interest for the distributional effects of labor market policies.  <br>
