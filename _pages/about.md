<img src="/images/profile.png" alt="drawing" width="350" height="300" style="float: left; padding-right:25px"/>    I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at UC Berkeley. I work mainly on topics in labor, public, discrimination and inequality.  Prior to coming to Berkeley, I worked as a pre-doctoral fellow at Harvard for the [Opportunity Insight lab](https://opportunityinsights.org/), after graduating from Paris School of Economics.
