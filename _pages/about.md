<img src="/images/profile.png" alt="drawing" width="350" height="300" style="float: left; padding-right:25px"/>   I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at UC Berkeley and will be on the job market during the 2020-21 academic year. I am available for interviews before, during and after the (virtual) 2021 AEA/ASSA meetings. I work on topics in labor, gender and public economics, with a particular interest for the distributional effects of labor market policies.  Prior to coming to Berkeley, I worked as a pre-doctoral fellow at Harvard for the [Opportunity Insight lab](https://opportunityinsights.org/), after an M.A. from the Paris School of Economics and Ecole Polytechnique.
