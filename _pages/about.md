<img src="/images/profile2.png" alt="drawing" width="390" height="300" style="float: left; padding-right:15px"/>  I joined MIT's Economics Department as an Assistant Professor in July 2023 after a postdoc at the LSE. I am also the Executive Director of the [Hub for Equal Representation](https://www.hubequalrep.org/) at the LSE. I received my Phd in Economics from UC Berkeley. <br>

My research is in the field of labor economics, with a particular interest in the determinants of imperfect competition and the role of information frictions in income inequality.  <br>
