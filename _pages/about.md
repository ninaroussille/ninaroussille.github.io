<img src="/images/profile.jpg" alt="drawing" width="400" height="520" style="float: left; padding-right:15px"/>   I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at UC Berkeley. I work on topics in labor, gender and public economics, with a particular interest for the distributional effects of labor market policies. <br>

Prior to coming to Berkeley, I worked as a pre-doctoral fellow at Harvard for the [Opportunity Insight lab](https://opportunityinsights.org/), after an M.A. from the Paris School of Economics and Ecole Polytechnique. <br>
<br>
I will join MIT's Economics Department as an Assistant Professor in 2023, after spending the 2021-2022 academic year as an Assistant Professorial Research Fellow at LSE and the 2022-2023 academic year as a Postdoctoral Associate at MIT.
