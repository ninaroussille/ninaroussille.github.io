<img src="/images/profile2.jpg" alt="drawing" width="700" height="520" style="float: left; padding-right:15px"/>  I am a Postdoctoral Associate at MIT and will join MIT's Economics Department as an Assistant Professor in 2023. I am also the Executive Director of the [Hub for Equal Representation](https://www.hubequalrep.org/) at the LSE, where I spent the 2021-2022 academic year as an Assistant Professorial Research Fellow. <br>

I work on topics in labor, gender and public economics, with a particular interest for the distributional effects of labor market policies.  <br>

I received my PhD in Economics from UC Berkeley in 2021 and previously worked as a pre-doctoral fellow at Harvard for the [Opportunity Insight lab](https://opportunityinsights.org/).
