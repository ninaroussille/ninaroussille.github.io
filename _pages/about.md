<img src="/images/profile.png" alt="drawing" width="350" height="300" style="float: left; padding-right:25px"/>   I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at UC Berkeley. I work on topics in labor, gender and public economics, with a particular interest for the distributional effects of labor market policies. <br>

Prior to coming to Berkeley, I worked as a pre-doctoral fellow at Harvard for the [Opportunity Insight lab](https://opportunityinsights.org/), after an M.A. from the Paris School of Economics and Ecole Polytechnique. <br>
<br>
*I will be on the job market during the 2020-21 academic year and available for interviews at the (virtual) 2020 EEA and 2021 AEA/ASSA meetings.*  <br>
