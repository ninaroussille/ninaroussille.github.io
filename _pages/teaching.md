I have served as a graduate student instructor (GSI) at Berkeley for Econ 140 (Economic statistics and Econometrics) in Fall 2018 and for Econ 133 (Global Inequality and Growth - taught by Gabriel Zucman) for Spring 2019 and Spring 2020. <br/>
I was awarded an Outstanding Graduate Student Instructor (GSI) award, which is given to the top 10% of GSIs, in 2020. Teachers are only eligible to win once.  <br/>
You can find the syllabus and class content for Econ 133 [here](http://gabriel-zucman.eu/econ133-2019/). <br/>
You can find a sample of my teaching evaluations [here](/files/Teachingevaluations.pdf).
