I have served as a graduate student instructor (GSI) at Berkeley for Econ 140 (Economic statistics and Econometrics) in Fall 2018 and for Econ 133 (Global Inequality and Growth) for  Spring 2019 and Spring 2020 
I was awarded a Outstanding Graduate Student Instructor (GSI) award, which is given to the top 10% of GSIs, in 2020. Teachers are only eligible to win once.
