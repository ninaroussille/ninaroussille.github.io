## Working paper

[**The central role of the ask gap in gender pay inequality**](/files/Roussille_askgap.pdf) <br/>

<!--- (/files/jmp.pdf) --->

**Abstract**: The gender ask gap measures the extent to which women ask for lower salaries than comparable men. This paper studies the role of the ask gap in generating wage inequality using novel data from Hired.com, a leading online recruitment platform for full time engineering jobs in the United States. To use the platform, job candidates must post an ask salary, stating how much they want to make in their next job. Firms then apply to candidates by offering a bid salary they are willing to pay the candidate. If the candidate is hired, final salary is recorded. After adjusting for resume characteristics, the ask gap is 3.3%, the bid gap is 2.4% and the gap in final offers is 1.8%. Remarkably, further controlling for the ask salary explains all of the gender gaps in bid and final salary on the platform. To estimate the market-level effects of an increase in women's ask salary, I exploit a sudden change in how candidates were prompted to provide their ask salary. For a subset of candidates, in mid-2018, the answer box used to solicit the ask salary went from an empty field to a pre-filled entry with the median salary on the platform for a similar candidate. Comparing candidates creating a profile before and after the feature change, I find that this change drove the ask gap and the bid gap to zero. In addition, women received the same number of bids before and after the change, suggesting they face little penalty for demanding wages comparable to men. <br/>

[**Tax evasion and the Swiss cheese regulation**](http://piketty.pse.ens.fr/files/Rousille2015.pdf) (new draft coming soon) <br/>

**Abstract**: The 2005 Savings Tax Directive is the most far-ranging tax policy initiative to date in the attempt to curb tax evasion of European households in Switzerland. Under this program, tax evaders holding interest-yielding accounts in Switzerland have two choices: they can either report their accounts to the fiscal authorities of their resident countries or they can pay a tax upfront and keep their anonymity. While celebrated as a major breakthrough, my computations show that less than 20% of the European offshore wealth in Switzerland is either taxed or declared under the Directive in 2013. This paper presents an exhaustive analysis of the loopholes in the Directive, shedding light on the strategic behavior of evaders to avoid paying the upfront tax. While they remain fairly low, declarations of offshore wealth under the Directive have more than quadrupled over the period 2006-2013. This paper demonstrates that monetary incentives, such as tax amnesties in the evader’s home country or the increase in the upfront tax in Switzerland, are the first drivers of declarations. Conversely, bilateral information exchange treaties that were praised as a way to “end bank secrecy” have by far the least effect on declarations. The policy implications of these findings are also discussed.<br/>
