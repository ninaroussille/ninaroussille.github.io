Standard labor market models assume that workers hold accurate beliefs about the
external wage distribution, and hence their outside options with other employers. We
test this assumption by comparing German workers’ beliefs about outside options
with objective benchmarks. First, we find that workers wrongly anchor their beliefs
about outside options on their current wage: workers that would experience a 10%
wage change if switching to their outside option only expect a 1% change. Second,
workers in low-paying firms underestimate wages elsewhere. Third, in response to
information about thewages of similarworkers, respondents correct their beliefs about
their outside options and change their job search and wage negotiation intentions.
Finally, we analyze the consequences of anchoring in a simple equilibrium model. In
the model, anchored beliefs keep overly pessimistic workers stuck in low-wage jobs,
which gives rise to monopsony power and labor market segmentation. <br/>

This paper studies how investors respond to tax evasion regulations in offshore
financial centers. We do so by analyzing the 2005 EU Savings Tax Directive,
which introduced a withholding tax on interest income earned by EU households in
Switzerland and other offshore centers. Exploiting a unique combination of public
administrative Swiss datasets, we find that the reform barely curbed tax evasion:
73% of the European offshore wealth in Switzerland remained both undeclared and
untaxed by the time the Directive was repealed. We show that the limited scope
of the Directive is mainly explained by tax evaders’ active re-investment strategies
in tax-exempt assets, as well as ownership transfer to sham corporations registered
in tax havens. We rationalize the drivers of declarations by means of a model and
document empirically that monetary incentives, such as the increase in the upfront
tax in Switzerland or tax amnesties in the evader’s home country, appear to be
the driving force behind the rise of declarations. Conversely, bilateral information
exchange treaties that were praised as a way to “end bank secrecy” have the least
effect on declarations. <br/>

The gender ask gap measures the extent to which women ask for lower salaries than comparable men.  This paper studies the role of the ask gap in generating wage inequality, using novel data from Hired.com, an online recruitment platform for full-time engineering jobs in the United States.  To use the platform, job candidates must post an ask salary, stating how much they want to make in their next job.  Firms then apply to candidates by offering them a bid salary, solely based on the candidate’s resume and ask salary.  If the candidate is hired, a final salary is recorded.  After adjusting for resume characteristics, the ask gap is 2.9%, the gap in bid salaries is 2.2%, and the gap in final offers is 1.4%.  Remarkably, further controlling for the ask salary explains the entirety of the residual gender gaps in bid and final salaries.  To estimate the market-level effects of an increase in women’s ask salaries, I exploit an unanticipated change in how candidates were prompted to provide their ask.  For some candidates in mid-2018, the answer box used to solicit the ask salary was changed from an empty field to an entry pre-filled with the median bid salary for similar candidates.  Using an interrupted time series design, I find that this change drove the ask gap, the bid and the final offer gap to zero. In addition, women did not receive fewer or worse bids or final offers than men did due to the change, suggesting they faced little penalty for demanding wages comparable to men. <br/>

  This paper studies the nature and implications of firm wage-setting conduct on a large online job board for full-time U.S. tech workers. Utilizing granular data on the choice sets and decisions of firms and job seekers, we first develop and implement a novel estimator of worker preferences that accounts for both the vertical and horizontal differentiation of firms. The average worker is willing to pay 14% of their salary for a standard deviation increase in firm amenities. However, at the average firm, the standard deviation of valuations of that firm’s amenities across coworkers is also equivalent to 14% of their salaries, indicating that preferences are not well-described by a single ranking of firms. Following the “New Empirical Industrial Organization” literature, we use our labor supply estimates to compute the wage markdowns implied by a series of models of firm conduct that vary in the degree to which worker preference heterogeneity gives rise to market power. We then formulate a testing procedure that can discriminate between these models. Oligopsonistic models of wage setting are rejected in favor of monopsonistic models exhibiting near uniform markdowns of roughly 18%. Relative to a competitive benchmark, imperfect competition substantially exacerbates gender gaps in both wages and welfare. However, blinding employers to the gender of job candidates would have negligible effects on wage inequality.

Before automatic exchange of information, the 2005 Savings Tax Directive was the most far-ranging initiative in the attempt to curb tax evasion of European households in Switzerland. Under this program, European tax evaders holding interest-yielding accounts in Switzerland had two choices: either declare their accounts to the fiscal authorities of their resident countries or pay a tax upfront and keep their anonymity. Exploiting a unique combination of public administrative datasets, this paper sheds light on the loopholes of this reform and the large behavioral responses of tax evaders aimed at exploiting them. I find that the reform barely curbed tax evasion : 80% of the European offshore wealth in Switzerland remained both undeclared and untaxed by 2013. Using the Swiss households’ investments as a control group, I show that the failure of the Directive is mainly explained by tax evaders’ active re-investment strategies in tax-exempt assets. While they remain fairly low, declarations of offshore wealth under the Directive have more than quadrupled over the period 2006-2013. This paper demonstrates that monetary incentives, such as tax amnesties in the evader’s home country or the increase in the upfront tax in Switzerland, are the first drivers of declarations. Conversely, bilateral information exchange treaties that were praised as a way to “end bank secrecy” have the least effect on declarations. <br/>
